# SwiftUI Views
## New Controls
* [AnyLayout](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/anylayout/) - A view that can represent a container view such as a VStack, HStack, grids, etc.
* [Gauge](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/gauge) - A view that shows a value within a range. This can be circular or straight.
* [Grid](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/grid) - A container view that arranges other views in a two dimensional layout with the use of the [GridRow](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/gridrow).
* [LabeledContent](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/labeledcontent/) - A container for attaching a label to a value-bearing view. This way it can layout appropriately depending on where it's used. For example, if in a Form, the label will be leading and the content portion will be trailing and gray.
* [Layout](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/gridrow) - Not exactly a new control but rather a new protocol that you can conform to so you can create your own custom layout container control.

* [NavigationStack](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationstack) - A view that displays a root view and enables you to present additional views over the root view. To navigate, use a NavigationLink in combination with the [navigationDestination](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/navigationdestination(for:destination:)) modifier. You can also specify a [NavigationPath](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationpath) to create or manage your stack of views.

* [ViewThatFits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewthatfits) - A container view that adapts to the available space by providing the first child view that fits.


## Updated Controls
### NavigationLink
* Works in combination with the [navigationDestination](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/navigationdestination(for:destination:)) modifier. NavigationLinks have values and if there is a navigationDestination modifier that matches the NavigationLink's value type, then it is used and navigates to the view the navigationDestination specifies.

### Stepper
* You can provide a [format](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/parseableformatstyle) parameter to handle conversions for number, percent, dateTime, iso8601 date format and now URL format.

### Toggle

There are over a dozen new searchable modifiers that can be used now. Rather than go through them all, I think it would be better to just list out some of the new parameters:
* **scope**: A binding for the active scope of the search field.
* **scopes**: A view builder representing the scopes of the search field which will be used to populate a Picker.
* **token**: A view builder that creates a view given an element in tokens.

## Text Input & Output

* The TextField can now overflow horizontally or vertically by specifying an [axis](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield/init(_:text:axis:)-7n1bm).
* A lienLimit modifier with one or a range of values can be added to specify how much the TextField can grow. Beyond that a scroll indicator will appear.
### TextEditor
* [findNavigator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/findnavigator(ispresented:)) - Programmatically presents the find and replace interface for text editor views.

## Images
The Image initializer now has a new parameter called [variableValue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image/init(_:variablevalue:bundle:)) that the rendered image can use to customize its appearance. If the symbols does not support it, this has no effect.
* [ImageRenderer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/imagerenderer) - An object that creates images from SwiftUI views. So you can compose a SwiftUI view and then generate an image or PDF from it.

# Animations
